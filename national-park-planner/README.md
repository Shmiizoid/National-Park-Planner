# Major Hurdles
- Dealing with server maintenance from the API host proved to be a hurdle for me. There was no schedule for the maintenance so I was unaware if my errors were caused by me or the API at times.

- User Authentication was very difficult at first, and once implemented it was still very difficult to create an experience tailored towards the user once they have signed up or logged in.

# Unsolved Problems
- Pagination was a little trickier than I thought and will need more time to implement it.

# Next Steps
- I plan to continue improving this app by ading pagination, additional user specific interface (user portal), and add more filters to make it easier for the user to find parks.
- I will also be implementing a Google Maps API functionality to the app.
